# Spam_Filter_of_YouTube_Comments

Summary:

*	Built a spam filter of the comments from five pop songs on YouTube.
*	Created a unigram dictionary of the comments from the first four songs using CountVectorizer in Python, and tracked the word counts of the messages. 
*	Fit a Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes model to the vectorized comments to predict whether a comment was spam. The comments from the fifth song were used to determine that the model predicted spam with 89% accuracy.
